            <i><b>Public Profile Privacy Review</b></i> is a web application that analyzes the privacy and security of a public social media account.<br><br>

            Developed using Flask in Python for the back end and Materialize in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, this app takes in a social media handle and utilizes social media API to scan the profile for personal information.<br><br>

            The web application displays the vulnerable information that is found from the social media profile and provides tips to the user on how important it is to improve their privacy online. Within 24 hours, our team of interns were able to have a functional demo of the web application and presented the project at hackathon for judging.<br><br>

            <i>Challenges we ran into: <br></i>At first, we wanted to use Snapchat's developer Snapkit. However, we found out that Snapkit only worked with Android and IOS developer tools, not React. Therefore, we had to switch gears and create our own login system.<br><br>
